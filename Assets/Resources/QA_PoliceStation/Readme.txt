Hi!
Thank you for purchase!

If you want to achieve the same visuals as on screenshots and video, check the Color Space settings in Player Settings, it should be set to Linear. Also check the Render Path settings in Graphics Settings, it should be set to Deferred.
Use free Unity 'Post Processing Stack V2' camera effects (which you can download from the Unity Asset Store or from the Package Manager) and the adjusted profile for that, which can be founded in the QA_PoliceStation/Demoscene/ folder.

NOTE: This project contains real fugitives posters from FBI website. FBI allows to copy and distribute these posters, but NOT ALLOW to alterate any portion of these posters. For more info, please go here and read: https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten

Thanks!
